A REQUEST FROM NATE547
======================
Once you install this font, find 2 ways to make the world, the country, your home state/province/county, or your hometown better than it is. Even if it's just recycling your newspaper instead of tossing it on the rubbish.

If you're upgrading from a previous version to 1.2, find two ways you contribute to global de-evolution (like not using your freedom of choice or giving authority to someone unworthy of it) and take immediate action to change it!
Of course, you're not obligated by law to do either of these things.... it's just a request from a Sensible Human who wants our world to change.

Duty now for the future.
